                        <p className="description">I built an Eigenface recognition system from the ground up, using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). This method is all about using math to recognize different faces. I did everything myself - coming up with the idea, coding, and making sure it worked right. My system was trained to be really good at figuring out who is who. During tests, it was great at spotting faces, even when they looked a bit different. This project showed that I can handle complex computer tasks. It was also a chance for me to dive deep into image processing and machine learning. Using PCA made the project challenging but really interesting. I learned a lot about how computers can learn to see and understand faces.</p>

In my latest project, I developed a Fisherface recognition model from scratch, showcasing my deep dive into facial recognition technology. This custom-built model was meticulously coded to optimize for accuracy and efficiency in recognizing diverse facial features and expressions. I undertook the complete development cycle, from initial research to coding and testing. The model was trained on a carefully curated dataset, ensuring robust learning and applicability. During testing, it demonstrated high efficiency and accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-world applications. This project not only honed my technical skills in machine learning and pattern recognition but also underscored my ability to manage and deliver complex, end-to-end solutions in advanced facial recognition technology.  </p>
